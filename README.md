# Instructions

Today's assignment consists of 3 ruby exercises. Each exercise has its own
directory. So, in the repository you will find:

- 09ideal_gas
- 10cupcake
- 11plurality

Inside each directory are 3 files: `exercise_name.rb`, `exercise_name_test.rb`
and `instructions.md`.

Modify `exercise_name.rb` inside each directory to fulfill the requirements
(check instructions.md). Run `exercise_name_test.rb` to run the test for each
exercise. Run `rubocop` to check for code-style offenses. Resolve every offense
before commit your work.

After committing your changes, push your changes to your Github repo.

Following the instructions, you need to modify the file `exercise_name.rb` so
the tests will pass.
